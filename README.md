# FileHunt

Search query builder for finding sensitive files on the web. Using Google Dorks, you are able to refine your search to find specific file types, keywords, and more.

I made this tool to help me learn React and Next.js, and to have a fun project to work on. I hope you find it useful!

## Live Demo

You can find a live demo of the project at [filehunt.3kh0.net](https://filehunt.3kh0.net).

## Running Locally

Same old same old, make sure you got node and pnpm installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Deploying

Because Vercel and Next.js are in bed together, just use them to deploy, they handle all the hard work for you.

## Contributing

Sure
